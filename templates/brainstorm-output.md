## The Territory

### {{Framing 1 — an evocative name, not a category}}

{{What does the topic look like through this lens? 3-5 paragraphs developing this reading fully, on its own terms. Include file references and footnotes. Do not reference other framings — this one stands alone. End with what this framing reveals and what it obscures.}}

### {{Framing 2}}

{{A genuinely different lens on the same material. Equally developed. NOT ranked against Framing 1.}}

### {{Framing 3}}

{{Continue as needed. 3-5 framings typical.}}

## Tensions

{{The productive frictions between framings. Each tension gets full treatment:}}

### {{X}} vs. {{Y}}

**The pull toward X:** {{why X is compelling, what it enables — 3-5 sentences, written with conviction}}

**The pull toward Y:** {{same treatment, equally committed}}

**What this tension reveals:** {{NOT a resolution. What question does this force? What does the irreconcilability itself tell you? 2-3 sentences.}}

### {{A}} vs. {{B}}

{{Same structure. As many tensions as the material warrants.}}

## Unexpected Connections

{{Cross-domain links the agents surfaced. Why these connections illuminate something new. Written as prose.}}

## Open Questions

{{Questions the brainstorm generated but did not answer. Genuinely open — not rhetorical, not implying their own answers. Each question should make the user want to think further, not act.}}
