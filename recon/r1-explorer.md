# Round 1 Explorer Report: What Culture Comes After Network Culture?

## Web Findings

### Cultural Transformation & AI Era

- [Large AI models are cultural and social technologies (Science)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adt9819): LLMs are not simply tools but actively reshaping society itself, akin to the printing press or markets—a new kind of cultural and social technology deeply embedded in core domains from language to knowledge production.

- [Navigating the Cultural Collapse: Four-Worlds Model in AI](https://www.oreateai.com/blog/navigating-the-cultural-collapse-understanding-the-fourworlds-model-in-ai/c752a60b08815599b0d8e95bd3113c15): Culture undergoes "structural collapse" when shifting from expressions rich with nuance and emotion to manifestations dominated by cold logic and computation. Culture transitions from fluid state to storable/retrievable as algorithms translate language and symbols into digital formats—like freezing water into ice.

- [Generative AI's hidden cultural tendencies (MIT Sloan)](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/press/generative-ais-hidden-cultural-tendencies): Generative AI is not culturally neutral—LLMs produce culturally distinct responses to the same prompt depending on language used, revealing embedded cultural patterns in AI behavior.

### Atomization & Fragmentation

- [The Age of Atomization (TechPolicy.Press)](https://www.techpolicy.press/the-age-of-atomization/): The global internet atomizes cultures, societies, and selves into tiny brilliant shards, exploding the subcultural mode. Content collapse replaces context collapse—social media blurs traditional distinctions causing us to lose ability to distinguish tragic from trivial.

- [Atomization: the kaleidoscope of meaning (Meaningness)](https://meaningness.com/atomized-mode): Culture atomizes into kaleidoscopic chaos of brightly-colored atoms of meaning, making it impossible to construct or maintain a coherent self. Genre—which defined many subcultures—has disintegrated; intensity (shock, novelty, extremes) substitutes for structure.

- [The spreading process of social atomization (Culturico)](https://culturico.com/2019/03/01/the-spreading-process-of-social-atomization/): Fragmentation of knowledge, loss of comprehensive cultural vision, rapid obsolescence of public customs are symptoms of social atomization. Decreased trust, less time with neighbors, reduced social participation.

### Vibe Shifts & Cultural Inflection Points

- [The Great Vibe Shift of 2025 (Medium)](https://medium.com/@sdespin/the-great-vibe-shift-of-2025-how-digital-culture-is-remaking-the-human-mood-ea8a90b99890): Collective sense that world's emotional atmosphere is changing. Sharp shift from optimism to uncertainty—not just trends but the entire societal mood.

- [Vibe Shift (Know Your Meme)](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/vibe-shift): Term from 2022 describing dramatic cultural change making current trends feel dated as new waves emerge. Four great vibe shifts identified: hipster/indie sleaze (2003-2009), post-internet/techno revival (2010-2016), Hypebeast/woke (2016-2021), and current moment.

- [The 'Vibe Shift' Is Here (Amy Odell)](https://amyodell.substack.com/p/the-vibe-shift-is-here-2022-was-just): Sean Monahan (who coined "normcore") predicted major cultural inflection point—rare sea change in popular tastes.

### Post-Network Concepts

- [Post-network era (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-network_era): Originally TV studies concept (Amanda D. Lotz) defined by five C's: choice, control, convenience, customization, and community—viewers have greater access to wider content consumed on their own terms.

- [Art Post-Internet (Google Arts & Culture)](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/art-post-internet-ullens-center-for-contemporary-art/MgUxxWs5PRkA8A?hl=en): Post-internet refers not to time "after" internet but to internet state of mind—art objects created with consciousness of networks within which they exist.

- [Institute of Network Cultures](https://networkcultures.org/): Organization analyzing network cultures through events, publications, online dialogue. Projects around urgent publishing, alternative revenue models, critical design, digital counter culture.

### Emerging Platform Dynamics

- [What's Next For Digital Products And Platforms (Xebia)](https://xebia.com/articles/whats-next-for-digital-products-and-platforms/): AI, edge computing, IoT reshaping software development. AR/VR finding applications in education, healthcare, gaming. Low-code platforms empowering non-developers.

- [How Culture Shapes What People Want from AI (Stanford HAI)](https://hai.stanford.edu/news/how-culture-shapes-what-people-want-ai): Prevailing view in AI development reflects cultural model of agency prevalent in European American middle-class contexts. Clear associations between cultural models and type of AI considered ideal.

## Unexpected Angles

- **Television Studies Framework**: The post-network era concept from TV studies (five C's: choice, control, convenience, customization, community) predates current discourse but maps surprisingly well onto broader cultural shift from centralized to distributed/personalized experience.

- **Thermodynamic Metaphor**: Wang Ligong's Four-Worlds Model uses phase-change metaphor (fluid culture "freezing" into retrievable data) to describe AI transformation—unexpected physical science framing for cultural logic shift.

- **Post-Internet Art Movement**: Art criticism's "post-internet" (consciousness of networks rather than chronology) offers precedent for thinking about cultural sensibility rather than technological succession.

- **Normcore as Predecessor**: Sean Monahan, who predicted current vibe shift, previously coined "normcore"—suggests pattern-recognition in cultural inflection points might itself be evolving meta-skill.

- **Intensity Over Structure**: In atomized mode, intensity (shock, novelty, extremes) substitutes for genre/structure—points to affective logic replacing categorical logic.

- **Cultural Bias in AI**: AI systems embed and reproduce cultural patterns, but this isn't neutral translation—they're actively creating new hybrid cultural logics based on training data origins.

## Suggested Follow-ups for Round 2

- **Computational culture vs algorithmic culture**: Search for distinctions between AI-era cultural logic and earlier network/platform logic. What specifically changes when LLMs become cultural infrastructure?

- **Affective/vibes-based epistemology**: The shift from arguments to vibes, from structure to intensity—is this a new way of knowing or just aesthetic surface?

- **Re-coherence after atomization**: Are there theories about what comes after fragmentation? Does culture re-cohere in new forms or stay atomized? Historical parallels to previous fragmentation epochs?

- **Agency models in AI era**: Stanford research hints at clash between cultural models of agency—what new models might emerge? Individual vs collective, human vs post-human?

- **Mastery as post-optimization**: One source mentioned "mastery as new status symbol" in post-optimization space—under-explored thread worth pursuing.

- **Community models**: Post-network era defined "community" as one of five C's but what does community mean when atomized? Are there emerging models of collective coherence?

- **Gap: Non-Western perspectives**: Most sources reflect Western (particularly US) framing. What do Chinese, African, Latin American thinkers say about post-network culture?

- **Gap: Embodiment**: Searches focused on digital/virtual—what about physical, spatial, material culture after networks? Sensing return to place, locality, body?
